%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

The high-radix, low-diameter dragonfly topology network will be the choice of many computing facilities for building their next generation supercomputers. Preliminary study shows that random job allocation with adaptive routing would be the rule of thumb to utilize such powerful network. However, in this work, we made the observation that although random job allocation with adaptive routing can alleviate the hotspot and make network traffic load-balanced for the workload, it can not guarantee the best performance for each single job. The performance improvement of communication intensive jobs comes with sacrifice of those less intensive jobs. We refer this phenomenon as ``bully" between concurrently running jobs. In this paper, we analyze the detailed reason for the happening of this ``bully" from the network level. Our study is based on a sophisticated, high-fidelity discrete even-driven simulation tool. We believe the observations and analysis in this work will make the chosen of job allocation and routing strategies more cautiously in future.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The low latency and high bandwidth interconnect network plays a critical role in improving HPC system performance. As the computing ability of HPC system continue grows due to many-core nodes with accelerators, the network is now becoming a scare resources. HPC community start to explore the possible alternative to replace the commonly used Torus network.

The building high-radix, low-diameter dragonfly topology can lower the cost of interconnect network, improve network bandwidth, reduce the packets traverse latency. This make the dragonfly network an very promising choice for building multi-Petaflop/s supercomputers\cite{dally-dragonfly}. The procurement results from Trinity and CORAL project shows the great performance improvement can be got from using dragonfly network. 


Even with such powerful network, the interference between concurrently running jobs and thus presumably job placement remains an major factor cause performance variability on dragonfly network\cite{bhatele2015, dskinner}. Some research work suggest that random job placement coupled with adaptive routing can alleviate local congestion, eliminate hot-spots and reach load-balance for dragonfly networks \cite{jain-sc14, bhatele-sc11, brandt2014}. 

This is paper, we study the interference between concurrently running jobs on dragonfly network with different job placement and routing schemes. Being unorthodox to most existing work that use synthetic workload, our work is based on application traces that collected from production system. The advantage of using real application traces is quite obvious. The traces collected from production system can capture application's communication behavior in detail that usually omitted in synthetic workload for the purpose of simplicity. 


%We also evaluate the network performance and jobs' performance when the Dragonfly network is configured with different job allocation strategies and routing algorithms. The job allocation strategies used in our study are Compact allocation and Random allocation, both of which can be seen in existing production HPC systems. The routing strategies been analyzed in this work are Minimal, Nonminimal and Adaptive.  


We made observation from our extensive study that, when dragonfly network enabled with random job placement and adaptive routing scheme in order to reach hot-spot free and load balance, the performance of particular job(s) in the workload would suffer degradation. The communication intensive jobs in the workload can benefit from random placement and adaptive routing, with great performance improvement. Unfortunately, those less intensive jobs are the sacrifices for this improvement, their performance will be greatly reduced. 

The findings in this work also reconfirm that interference between concurrently running jobs would make the performance of some jobs very unpredictable. The detailed analysis about the traffic and congestion in network level unveil the undercurrent beneath that interference. This work makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
   
    \item Our real trace-based analysis about job interference on dragonfly network, shows that random placement with adaptive routing can not guarantee the performance of every job in the workload. The hotspot-free and load-balanced reached by using random placement with adaptive routing come with the cost of communication-less-intensive jobs performance degradation. 

    \item We identify the ``bully" behavior happening between jobs running concurrently on dragonfly network with random placement and adaptive routing. Random placement and adaptive routing redirect the traffic of communication intensive jobs to the routers through which less intensive jobs' traffic used to go, embezzle the network resources, slow down the communication of those less intensive jobs.

    
    \item We found that contiguous placement and minimal routing can guarantee the consistent performance of each job running on dragonfly network, while may leads to local hotspot and severe network congestion. Actually, contiguous placement and minimal routing are preferred by communication-less-intensive jobs, since it will prevent them from being bullied by other communication-intensive jobs.
    
         
\end{itemize}

To the best of our knowledge, using application traces from production system for the study of job interference on dragonfly network as not been reported so far. We believe the observations and analysis presented in this paper can be used by computing facilities to choose job placement and routing strategies wisely for their future dragonfly interconnected system. The conclusion from this paper would be useful for batch schedulers in dragonfly system to make better scheduling decisions for workload consists of jobs that have various communication behavior.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
The dragonfly network is promising alternative for connecting a large number of nodes for its high-radix and low-diameter topology\cite{dally-dragonfly} \cite{kim-micro} \cite{faanes}. However, even with such powerful network, the job placement and routing could still be important factor that impact application's performance. 


\subsection{Dragonfly Network Overview}
\label{sec:network}
The dragonfly is a two-level hierarchical topology. It consists of several groups connected by All-to-All links. In each group, there could be ``a" number of routers connected via All-to-All local channels. For each router, there could be ``p" number of compute nodes attached to it via terminal link. The router has ``h" number of global channels that used as intergroup connections through which the router connected to other router in different groups. Thus, the radix of each router is $k = a+h+p-1$. The implementation of such dragonfly network could be different between different computing facilities. The choosing of proper $a$, $h$, $p$ could be involving many factors, such as system scale, building cost and workload requirements. 

For the purpose of loading balance, it is recommended that the proper dragonfly configuration is $a=2p=2h$\cite{kim-micro}. Under this configuration, the total number of groups ``g" in the dragonfly network would be $g = a*h+1 $, the total number of compute nodes ``N" in the network would be $N = p*a*g = $.

\begin{figure}[h!] 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{dragonfly-overview}
  \caption{Dragonfly Network Overview. Illustration of part of dragonfly network. There are 19 groups, 6 routers in each group, 3 compute nodes connected to each router, 342 nodes in total. Job\_1 requires for 6 nodes, get the allocation by Random placement. Job\_2 requires for 8 nodes, get the allocation by Contiguous placement. }
  \label{fig: dragonfly overview}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Job Placement}
\label{sec:placement-routing}

Job placement refers to the scheme used by batch scheduler to allocate the required number of nodes by the job for execution. As studied by several researchers, the job placement could be an important factor that impact application performance \cite{hoefler-hpdc14} \cite{bhatele-sc11} \cite{jain-sc14}. In this work, we study the following two placement schemes:

\textbf{Contiguous Placement:} In this scheme, the nodes will first be indexed consecutively in the increasing oder of their group id and router id. The job is allocated by cutting chunks of nodes from the sequentially ordered list, as illustrated in Figure\ref{fig: dragonfly overview} as blue nodes. The nodes been allocated to each job will be adjacent to each other, usually they are attached to the same router, in the same group. Contiguous placement confines the traffic of application into the local area, which may leads to local network congestion and increase the possibility of hot-spots. 

\textbf{Random Placement:} In this scheme, job will get a set of nodes that randomly selected from all the available nodes in the system. The nodes allocated to each job would be attached to different routers in different groups, as illustrated in Figure\ref{fig: dragonfly overview} as red nodes. Some routers may be shared by different applications when using random placement. Random placement can spreading the traffic of application uniformly across the whole system, thus avoid the possible hot-spots and reach load balance.


\subsection{Routing Schemes}
\label{sec:routing}

The implemented routing schemes in CODES dragonfly network model are based on the routing algorithm proposed by Kim et al. \cite{dally-dragonfly}. Two routing schemes studied in this work are \emph{Minimal} and \emph{Adaptive}.

\textbf{Minimal:} The minimal routing sends a message from source router to destination router along the shortest path. When there are multiple shortest paths, the message is evenly divided among the paths. Minimal routing can guarantee the minimum hops the message takes from source to destination. However, it may leads to congestion along the shortest path. 


\textbf{Adaptive:} In this scheme, the path a message takes will be adaptively chosen between shortest and non-shortest path, depends on the congestion situation along that path. For the non-shortest path, an intermediate router will be randomly chosen. The message will first take the shortest path from source to that intermediate router, then it will take the shortest path between the intermediate router to the destination. Since adaptive scheme chooses routing path adaptively based on the congestion situation, it can void local congestion and reduce the possibility of hot-spots. 

\textbf{Progressive Adaptive:} \NOTE{say something about prog-adaptive routing.} \cite{won-prog-adaptive}.




\section{Methodology}
\label{sec: methodology}

It is difficult to do experiment with concurrently running jobs on HPC system. One reason is that job placement and routing strategy are part of system configuration, it is impossible for user to make changes at will. Another reason is that it is unrealistic to reserve the system exclusively to run the same batch of jobs with desired placement and routing configurations and compare the results. Therefore, we resort to simulation in our work.

\subsection{Simulation Tool}
A simulation toolkit named CODES, Co-Design of Multilayer Exascale Storage Architectures, enables the exploration of simulating different HPC networks with high fidelity and great scalability\cite{codes}.  CODES support dragonfly network with high fidelity flit-level simulation\cite{codes-dragonfly}. It has this network workload component that is capable of taking real MPI application traces generated by SST DUMPI\cite{sst} for trace-driven simulations.

\subsection{Application Traces}
\label{sec: application traces}

We choose three representative applications from DOE Design Forward Project\cite{designforwardwebpage}. We believe these applications can be representative of a wide array of applications running on leadership-class supercomputers. Specifically, we study the Algebraic MultiGrid Solver (AMG), Geometric MultiGrid (MultiGrid) and CrystalRouter MiniApps. 

AMG: The Algebraic MultiGrid Solver, is a parallel algebraic multi-grid solver for linear systems arising from problems on unstructured mesh physics packages. It has been derived directly from the BoomerAMG solver that is being developed in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at LLNL\cite{amg}. The traces of AMG we chosen are comprised of 216 MPI ranks.

MultiGrid: massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) codes a software framework for massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) codes\cite{boxlib}. It is widely used for structured grid physics packages. The traces of MultiGrid we chosen are comprised of 125 MPI ranks.

CrystalRouter: the extracted communication kernel of the full application Nek5000\cite{nek5000}, which is a spectral element CFD application developed at Argonne National Laboratory\cite{crystalrouter}. It features spectral element multi-grid solvers coupled with a highly scalable, parallel coarse-grid solver that is widely used for projects including ocean current modeling, thermal hydraulics of reactor cores,and spatiotemporal chaos. The traces of CrystalRouter we chosen are comprised of 100 MPI ranks.



\subsection{Simulation Configuration}
\label{sec: simulation configuration}

The dragonfly network studied in this work consists of 33 groups, each group contains 8 routers and each router has 4 compute nodes attached to it. Overall, there are 264 routers and 1056 compute nodes in the network. The bandwidth of both terminal links and local channel are set to 2GB/s, the global channel bandwidth is set to 4GB/s. 

There are 6 placement and routing scheme combinations, namely contiguous placement coupled with minimal routing, contiguous placement coupled with adaptive routing, contiguous placement coupled with progressive adaptive routing random placement coupled with minimal routing, random placement coupled with adaptive routing, random placement coupled with progressive adaptive routing.  In this work, we enable the applications running on dragonfly network under different placement and routing configurations, and scrutinize the application's performance and network behavior in different running scenarios.

\section{Parallel Workload \Rmnum{1 } Study}
\label{sec: workload 1 overview}

The first parallel workload analyzed in our experiment consists of three applications, namely AMG , MultiGrid (MG) and CrystalRouter(CR). The details of this workload shown in Table \ref{tab: parallel workload-1}.

In our experiments, the workload running on the dragonfly network under 6 different job placement and routine scheme configurations as listed in Table \ref{tab: placement routing config}. We focus on the analysis of network status while the workload is running, as well as the performance of each individual application. We collected the following result data from the experiments:
\begin{itemize}
    \item router terminal link traffic and busy time.
    \item router local channel traffic and busy time.
    \item router global channel traffic and busy time.
    \item The time application spend on communication. 
\end{itemize}


\TODO{need a figure show workload communication time!!!}

Figure \ref{fig:wkld-network-traffic} shows the amount of traffic go through terminal links, local channels and global channels when the workload running on dragonfly network with 6 different placement and routing configurations, and Figure \ref{fig:wkld-network-stime} shows the corresponding busy time. 

%global link traffic and busy time explanation
When the workload is running with contiguous placement and minimal routing, all the MPI ranks are physically adjacent to each other, and the packets are routed through the shortest path between its source rank to destination rank. In this case, all the traffic are on the first half of the network (node id from 0 to $216+125+100-1=440$, group id from 0 to 13 ), causing the network local congestion and traffic load on some routers are extremely high, as shown the blue dash line in Figure \ref{fig:global-channel-traffic}. Thus the busy time of global channel is also the highest when contiguous placement coupled with minimal routing, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:global-channel-stime} the blue dash line. 

When contiguous placement is coupled with adaptive routing or progressive adaptive routing, the local congestion on global channel will be greatly alleviated, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:global-channel-traffic} the red and green dash line. Since both adaptive and progressive adaptive routing are congestion aware, and be able to utilize the idle routers on the other part of the network. The busy time of global channel are also reduce by using contiguous placement coupled with either adaptive or progressive adaptive routing, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:global-channel-stime} the red and green dash line. 

Random placement can randomly allocate the MPI ranks to the physical nodes all over the network, thus prevent the traffic from congesting certain part of the network. Shown as the solid lines in Figure \ref{fig:global-channel-traffic}, the traffic go through global channels are quite uniformly distributed across all the routers in the network, thus no particular global channel will suffer high traffic burden. When the random placement coupled with minimal routing, the packets can avoid unnecessary intermediate forwarding as introduced by adaptive and progressive routing, which results in generating less traffic. That's why the blue solid line is lower than the red and green solid line, shown in figure\ref{fig:global-channel-traffic}. Since the random placement can uniformly distribute the workload traffic, there are no sudden surge of busy time of global channel over the network, shown as solid lines in Fgiure \ref{fig:global-channel-stime}.

%local channel traffic and busy time explanation

We can get the same observation from the local channel traffic (Figure \ref{fig:local-channel-traffic}) and busy time (Figure \ref{fig:local-channel-stime}). Contiguous placement coupled with minimal routing results in local congestion, thus highest traffic amount on the local channel of certain routers. Even with adaptive or progressive adaptive routing, the local congestion caused by grouping MPI rank on adjacent nodes in contiguous placement can not be eliminated. The random placement can reduce the congestion on local channel for allocating MPI ranks to random selected nodes. 

%terminal link traffic and busy time explanation
The distribution of traffic go through terminal links stay unchanged no matter which placement and routing configuration are used, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:terminal-link-traffic}. This is because only the location of each MPI rank in the network will be changed in different placement schemes, and the routing won't have effect the terminal link, so the traffic between compute node and the router won't change. Due to the traffic changes on global and local channels, the busy time of terminal links will also experience some variation when different placement and routing scheme configuration in use, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:terminal-link-stime}.

\NOTE{The take-home message} from Figure \ref{fig:wkld-network-stime} and \ref{fig:wkld-network-traffic}. 

Contiguous placement allocates MPI ranks to physical nodes that are adjacent to each other, which confines the workload traffic to some local area when coupled with minimal routing. This may leads to hot-spot in local area and unbalanced network utilization. As we can see from Figure \ref{fig:wkld-network-traffic} and \ref{fig:wkld-network-stime}, contiguous placement coupled with minimal routing always leads to the extreme high traffic amount for some routers , and thus longest busy time.

Random placement allocates MPI ranks to a set of randomly selected nodes all over the system, which will uniformly distribute workload traffic and avoid local congestion. When random placement is coupled with minimal routing, the packets will take the shortest path from source router to the destination router without routing to any intermediate routers, this will prevent the routing from generating extra traffic. When random placement is coupled with adaptive or progressive adaptive routing, the possibility of any congestion will be further reduced at the cost of extra intermediate traffic. 


% Start from here, we present the individual application analysis.
The random job placement coupled with either minimal or adaptive routing can reach hot-spots free and load-balanced by distributing the workload traffic over the network. The workload performance get greatly improved with these configurations. However, when we isolated individual application from the workload, we unveil the fact that not every application can benefit from random job placement.

   \label{fig:apps-commtime}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:apps-commtime} shows the communication time of three applications running concurrently under 6 different placement and routing configurations listed in Table\ref{tab: placement routing configs}.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:mg-commtime} \ref{fig:cr-commtime}, MG and CR suffer the longest communication time when running under the configuration of contiguous placement and minimal routing(CM). When contiguous placement coupled with adaptive or progressive adaptive routing, both MultiGrid and CrystalRouter will get great improvement in terms of communication efficiency. Random placement will further reduce the communication time of MultiGrid and CrystalRouter, and reach the best performance when coupled with (progressive) adaptive routing. Both MultiGrid and CrystalRouter shows the same trend as the workload when running under different placement and routing configurations. 

However, AMG's performance is quite an exception. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:amg-commtime}, the communication time of AMG is skyrocketing when it running under random placement coupled with (progressive) adaptive routing. The contiguous placement coupled with (progressive) adaptive routing can reach the best performance for AMG. The performance of AMG running under contiguous placement coupled with minimal routing is no better than random coupled with minimal routing, but still much better than random with (progressive) adaptive routing. 

% Show the evidence from network level, explain why AMG is different. 
We look into network level to identify the major culprit behind AMG's abnormal behavior with random placement and adaptive routing. By identifying the terminal nodes and routers that each application's traffic go through, we can see that the traffic amount go through the routers that belongs to AMG is skyrocketing when it running with random placement and adaptive routing, shown in Figure \ref{fig:amg-lc-traffic} and Figure \ref{fig:amg-gc-traffic}. Adaptive routing will redirect the traffic of other applications to go through the routers belongs to AMG, and increase the burden of those routers, thus slow down the communication of AMG. \textbf{More explanation about contiguous placement and minimal routing}

CrystalRouter and MultiGrid can get obvious benefit from random placement and adaptive routing, as we can see from Figure \ref{fig:cr-gc-traffic} \ref{fig:cr-lc-traffic} and Figure \ref{fig:mg-gc-traffic} \ref{fig:mg-lc-traffic}, random placement and adaptive routing can redirect their traffic to other region of network, to avoid local congestion as appeared with contiguous and minimal routing. \textbf{More explanation about contiguous placement and minimal routing}

Why AMG is the only victim in the workload? The reason for CrystalRouter and MultiGrid get improvement in the sacrifice of AMG's performance is that AMG is the lest communication-intensive application in the workload. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:3app-data-amount}, AMG has the least amount of data transfer between its ranks. 

\begin{figure*}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=2.2in]{data_amount}
  \caption{Applications Data Transfer Amount. AMG has the least amount of data transfer, compared with CR and MG.}
  \label{fig:3app-data-amount}
\end{figure*}

Apparently, random placement and adaptive routing is quite efficient for orchestrate the traffic load in the network. Random placement and adaptive routing can uniformly distribute the workload traffic all over the network, make the load-balanced and avoid hot-spots. However, application like AMG will be impaired in this orchestration. The routers through which the less communication-intensive application traffic used to route, now have more traffic go through them. These extra traffic are from other communication-intensive applications. Beneath the facade of harmony, less communication-intensive application are ``bullied" by their communication-intensive peers in the workload. 

We have tried three different congestion sensing schemes that used in adaptive routing\cite{dally-dragonfly}, although there are some variations of the experiments, none of the congestion sensing scheme can prevent the ``bully" from happening. 

\section{Parallel Workload \Rmnum{2 } Study}

To validate our assumption, we generate synthetic application, sAMG, which are same the with AMG's original traces in every aspect expect that the data transfer amount 100x greater than AMG. We run the new workload that consists of sAMG, MG and CR on the same dragonfly network with the same placement and routing configurations. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:syn-3app-data-amount}, sAMG become the most communication-intensive application in the new workload.

The less communication-intensive application, CrystalRouter and MultiGrid, suffer prolonged communication time when running concurrently with sAMG with random placement and adaptive routing configuration. The routers that belongs to MultiGrid  and now CrystalRouter has extra traffic go through them, shown in Figure  \ref{fig:syn-mg-lc-traffic} \ref{fig:syn-mg-gc-traffic} and Figure \ref{fig:syn-cr-lc-traffic} \ref{fig:syn-cr-gc-traffic}. The extra traffic come from sAMG, that been redirected by adaptive routing. \textbf{More explanation about contiguous placement and minimal routing}.

\textbf{We can add another set of synthetic workload, in which three applications have similar data transfer amount, if necessary. }

Based on the results we got from both real application traces and synthetic workload, we can make the following observations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Random placement and adaptive routing can uniformly distribute workload traffic over the network, make the whole network load-balanced and hot-spot free. 
    \item Random placement and adaptive routing can not guarantee QoS for each application in the workload. In order to reach load-balanced and hot-spot free, the traffic from congested routers will be redirected to other less busy routers. This will indulge the ``bully" that communication-intensive applications impose to their less intensive peers. 
    \item Contiguous placement and minimal routing guarantee a consistent performance of each application. Although, contiguous placement and minimal routing usually results in local congestion and hot-spot, it can reduce the interference between concurrently running applications, thus prevent less communication-intensive application from being ``bully" by its intensive peers.
\end{itemize}


According to our findings, we believe choosing the ideal placement and routing strategies for workload running on dragonfly network should be based on application's communication intensity. The less intensive applications should avoid sharing network resource with other applications, reduce the possible interference. Contiguous placement and adaptive routing can guarantee the QoS for the less intensive applications, thus prevent the ``bully" from happening. 

The communication-intensive applications tend to cause local congestion. It is preferable to enable communication-intensive applications to have extra network resource by sharing with other applications.  Random placement and adaptive routing can alleviate the local congestion by redirecting traffic to other less busy routers in the network. 

So the ideal placement and routing strategies for workload running on dragonfly network should be like this. The communication-intensive applications should be randomly allocated over the system and adaptive routing should be used by these applications to alleviate the local congestion. On the other hand, less intensive application should get contiguous allocation, minimal routing should be used by these applications to avoid network sharing and reduce interference. 
 


\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related work}

The impact of job placement to both system and application always catch researchers appetite \cite{dskinner} \cite{abhinav-sc13} \cite{jose-ipdps15}. Skinner et al.\cite{dskinner} identified that network congestion could cause significant performance variability. Bhatele et al. \cite{abhinav-sc13} studied the performance variability of a specific application, p3FD, running on different production system. They noticed that the application performance would keep consistent when it got compact allocation and exclusive network resource. Jokanovic et al.\cite{jose-ipdps15} study the impact of job placement to the workload and claimed that the key to reduce performance variability is to avoid network sharing. 

Recently, several researchers have investigated the job placement and routing schemes on dragonfly network. Bogdan et al \cite{hoefler-hpdc14} proposed novel solution for mapping tasks of application that conforms to Nearest Neighbor communication pattern on dragonfly network. Jain et al. \cite{jain-sc14} conducted a comprehensive analysis of various job placement and routing scheme with regard to network link throughput on dragonfly network. Their work is based on an analytical model and synthetic workload. Bhatele et al.\cite{bhatele-sc11} used simulation to study the performance of synthetic workload under the different task mapping and routing schemes on two-level direct networks.


Our work different from the previous works in the following ways. First, instead of using synthetic workload that generated based on predefined communication patterns, our simulation is driven real application traces collected from production system. Second, not only we care about the workload performance, but also we pay attention to each individual application in the workload. We found that although random placement and adaptive routing can improve the workload performance, some specific application in the workload may suffer performance degradation. Third, with the sophisticated simulation tool CODES, we can get not only applications communication information, but also we have the insight about the network status when application is running. The traffic and busy time of router's each link are valuable information for detailed analysis.
