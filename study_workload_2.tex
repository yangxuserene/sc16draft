%\section{``Bully" become ``bullied"}
\label{sec:workload-2}

In this section, we use a different experimental configuration to verify and
explore the observations made in the previous section. Specifically, we conduct
the same sets of experiments through Workload~\Rmnum{2}, which consists of sAMG,
MultiGrid and CrystalRouter. By replacing AMG with sAMG, we turn the ``bully"
into the ``bullied".

\subsection{Network Performance Analysis}
\label{sec: workload-2 network analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:synwkld-network-traffic-stime} shows aggregate traffic and
saturation times for Workload~\Rmnum{2}, corresponding to
Figure~\ref{fig:wkld-network-traffic-stime} in Workload~\Rmnum{1}.  Replacing
AMG with sAMg results in greater aggregate traffic as well as more saturation
than in Workload~\Rmnum{1}, but regardless, similar patterns can be observed.
Contiguous placement with minimal routing results in load imbalances with
respect to both traffic and saturation. The addition of adaptive routing
alleviates these effects to some degree, particularly with respect to global
channel usage, while trading off saturation in global channels for saturation in
the local channels. \TODO{Did we make this observation in the earlier section?
Should check...} Using random placement again shows roughly similar performance
characteristics across routing configurations, with adaptive routing helping to
balance aggregate load while increasing the aggregate traffic due to the related
indirection.

\subsection{Individual Application Analysis}
\label{sec: workload-2 app analysis}

We study the performance of each application individually in the same manner as
in Section~\ref{sec: workload-1 app analysis}.
Figure~\ref{fig:syn-apps-commtime} shows the communication time distributions of
the ranks of the three applications, running concurrently in Workload~\Rmnum{2}.
The ``bully" in Workload~\Rmnum{1} becomes the ``bullied" in Workload~\Rmnum{2}. 
MultiGrid and CrystalRouter are the less communication-intensive applications in Workload~\Rmnum{2}. 
When random placement coupled with (progressive) adaptive routing is in use, 
MultiGrid and CrystalRouter suffer prolonged communication time, 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:syn-mg-commtime}, \ref{fig:syn-cr-commtime}. 
Whereas, sAMG (Figure~\ref{fig:syn-samg-commtime}) benefits from random placement and (progressive) adaptive routing
in a similar manner to CrystalRouter in Figure~\ref{fig:cr-commtime}.
Contiguous placement coupled with minimal routing, while preventing the bully
behavior, results in poor performance for all of the apps, except CrystalRouter,
which we also expect is due to a higher degree of performance isolation.

\end{figure*}



% explain the network status of sAMG, MG and CR
Once again, we look at the network-level system view to scrutinize the traffic through the routers serving each application. 
The routers serving sAMG have a high volume of traffic on both local and global channels when contiguous placement is in use, 
as shown in Figures~\ref{fig:syn-samg-lc-traffic} and \ref{fig:syn-samg-gc-traffic}.
As in previous results, the use of random placement alleviates the local congestion by uniformly distributing the traffic of sAMG over the network, getting more routers involved in serving sAMG.
In this case, a majority of those less busy routers are also serving MultiGrid and CrystalRouter.



%MultiGrid and CrystalRouter are the less communication-intensive applications in Workload~\Rmnum{2}.
When MultiGrid is running with contiguous placement, the serving routers have a comparatively small volume of traffic on their local and global channels, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:syn-mg-lc-traffic} and \ref{fig:syn-mg-gc-traffic}. When coupled with (progressive) adaptive routing, more MultiGrid traffic traverses global channels, while more aggregate traffic is seen on the local channels due to the additional intermediate hops.
When random placement is in use, the MPI ranks of MultiGrid are randomly distributed across the network and share routers with other applications. The routers serving MultiGrid have much more traffic on their local and global channels, as shown in Figures~\ref{fig:syn-mg-lc-traffic} and \ref{fig:syn-mg-gc-traffic}. The increased traffic comes largely from sAMG.

While CrystalRouter is more communication-intensive than MultiGrid, it still becomes the victim of the ``bully" sAMG. We can observe the similar pattern about CrystalRouter from Figure~\ref{fig:syn-cr-lc-traffic},~\ref{fig:syn-cr-gc-traffic} as MultiGrid. When random placement is in use, the routers serving CrystalRouter experience just as much, if not more, traffic than the contiguous placement in the extreme case, much of which originating from other applications (sAMG).

\subsection{Observations}

\NOTE{rewrote this somewhat. The observations made were essentially the same
as the previous section}

Revisiting the observations in Section~\ref{sec:workload-1-observations}, we
find that those observations are held under this separate configuration.
System-level performance is still much improved in terms of load-balancing.
sAMG, being far and away the most communication-intensive application, benefits
greatly from random placement, whereas in Workload~\Rmnum{1} it was effectively
penalized for being less communication-intensive. CrystalRouter, being the
comparatively less communication-intensive application in Workload~\Rmnum{2},
experiences performance regressions in Workload~\Rmnum{2} under random-adaptive
policies.

Interestingly, in both Workload~\Rmnum{1} and \Rmnum{2}, MultiGrid experiences
a more subtle performance behavior than the significant swings in performance
seen in the other applications. These behaviors persisted across multiple runs
with different random seeds. We are continuing to work towards understanding
the root causes and implications of this behavior. \TODO{Is this a reasonable
observation?}
